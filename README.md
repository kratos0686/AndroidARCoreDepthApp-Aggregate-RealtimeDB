# Room Scanner

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project was initialized with basic scaffolding. To generate the platform-specific code (Android, iOS, Web, etc.), run the following command in this directory:

```bash
flutter create .
```

This will create the necessary `android/`, `ios/`, `web/`, `linux/`, `macos/`, and `windows/` directories based on your environment configuration.

## Requirements

- Flutter SDK
- Android Studio / Xcode (for mobile development)

## Running the App

After generating the platform code:

```bash
flutter run
```

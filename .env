# SECURITY NOTICE: AI Features Disabled by Default
# =============================================================================
# 
# Gemini AI integration is DISABLED in this repository to prevent accidental
# exposure of API keys and to ensure secure practices.
#
# DO NOT add real API keys to this file or commit them to version control.
#
# To enable AI features securely:
#
# Option 1: Backend Proxy (RECOMMENDED for production)
#   - Set up a secure backend service to handle Gemini API calls
#   - Pass requests through your authenticated backend
#   - Keep API keys in your backend's secret manager (e.g., Firebase Secret Manager,
#     AWS Secrets Manager, Google Cloud Secret Manager)
#
# Option 2: CI/CD Secret Injection (for development/testing)
#   - Store API keys in your CI/CD platform's secret manager
#   - Inject secrets at build time using environment variables
#   - Never commit the injected secrets to version control
#
# To re-enable Gemini API (for development with caution):
#   1. Modify lib/domain/service/gemini_service.dart and 
#      lib/domain/service/iicrc_assistant_service.dart to remove the
#      exception-throwing stubs
#   2. Add your API key via secure secret injection
#   3. NEVER commit the API key to version control
